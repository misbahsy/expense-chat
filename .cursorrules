## Next.js App Router Guidelines

### Folder Structure

- **`app/`**: Main application directory using the App Router.
    - **`api/`**: Contains all API route handlers.
    - **`components/`**: Reusable React components.
    - **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks.
    - **`styles/`**: Global and layout-specific styles.
    - **`lib/`**: Utility functions and libraries.
    - **`public/`**: Static assets like images, fonts, and other public files.

### API Routes

- **Location**: Place all API route files within the `app/api/` directory.
- **Structure**:
    - Each API route should reside in its own subdirectory named after the endpoint.
    - Use `route.js` or `route.ts` files to define the HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- **Best Practices**:
    - Follow RESTful API design principles.
    - Validate and sanitize all incoming data.
    - Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

### Components

- **Location**: Store all reusable components in the `app/components/` directory.
- **Organization**:
    - Group components by feature or functionality.
    - Use subdirectories for complex or related components.
- **Naming Conventions**:
    - Use PascalCase for component filenames (e.g., `Navbar.jsx`).
    - Prefix component names appropriately to indicate their purpose.

### Hooks

- **Location**: Place custom hooks in the `app/hooks/` directory.
- **Naming Conventions**:
    - Prefix custom hooks with `use` (e.g., `useAuth`).
- **Best Practices**:
    - Ensure hooks are reusable and encapsulate related logic.
    - Keep hooks focused on a single responsibility.

### Styles

- **Location**: Manage styles in the `app/styles/` directory.
- **Approach**:
    - Use CSS Modules for component-scoped styling.
    - Define global styles in `globals.css` or equivalent.
    - Consider using CSS-in-JS solutions like Styled Components if preferred.
- **Naming Conventions**:
    - Use descriptive class names.
    - Follow a consistent naming pattern for easier maintenance.

### Utility Functions

- **Location**: Store utility functions in the `app/lib/` directory.
- **Organization**:
    - Group related utilities into subdirectories or files.
- **Best Practices**:
    - Write pure functions to ensure predictability and testability.
    - Document utility functions for clarity and ease of use.

### Public Assets

- **Location**: Place all static assets in the `public/` directory.
- **Usage**:
    - Reference assets using absolute paths (e.g., `/images/logo.png`).
    - Optimize images and other media for performance.

### Routing

- **App Router**: Utilize Next.js App Router for defining routes.
    - Structure routes based on the directory hierarchy within `app/`.
    - Leverage nested layouts for shared UI components and state.

### Data Fetching

- **Server Components**: Use server-side rendering for data-intensive components.
- **Client Components**: Utilize client-side rendering for interactive elements.
- **API Integration**:
    - Fetch data from API routes using `fetch` or a preferred HTTP client.
    - Handle loading and error states gracefully in the UI.

### State Management

- **Approach**: Choose a state management solution that fits the application's complexity.
    - Options include React Context, Redux, Zustand, or others.
- **Best Practices**:
    - Keep the global state minimal and relevant.
    - Avoid unnecessary re-renders by optimizing state selectors.

### Testing

- **Location**: Place tests alongside components or in a separate `tests/` directory.
- **Tools**: Use testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Best Practices**:
    - Write unit tests for individual components and functions.
    - Implement integration tests for API routes and complex interactions.

### Deployment

- **Preparation**:
    - Ensure environment variables are properly configured.
    - Optimize the build for production using `next build`.
- **Platforms**: Deploy on platforms that support Next.js, such as Vercel, Netlify, or AWS.
- **Monitoring**:
    - Set up logging and monitoring to track application performance and errors.

### Miscellaneous

- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control, following a consistent branching strategy.
- **Code Formatting**: Enforce code consistency using tools like Prettier and ESLint.
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation for developers and stakeholders.
